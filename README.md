# dita-projects
Sample DITA project, *Trello Guide*, with multiple maps, from simple to complex structure and architecture.

Main ditamaps:  
* _trello-simple.ditamap_: contains only basic metadata and topicrefs. No subfolders, reuse, keys, filters, etc.  
* _trello-simple-reltable.ditamap_: ads a two-column reltable   
* _trello-submaps.ditamap_: ads maprefs from subfolders.  
* _trello-conrefs.ditamap_: ads warehouse and conrefs.  
* _trello-filtering.ditamap_: ads filters. Use the filter files in en/ditavals/ and evtl. clone some more topics in en/source/for-filtering, not to mess up other maps. 
* _trello-local-keys.ditamap_: ditamap with topicrefs, maprefs, reltable, warehouse and conrefs, keys and keymaps (all local), but without filters.  
* _trello-glosskeys.ditamap_: ditamap with topicrefs, maprefs, reltable, warehouse and conrefs, keys and keymaps (all local), glossary, but without filters.  
* _trello.ditamap_:  initial (backup) model.

To do:  
Separate project for all-keys version and "out of scope" topics and maps.
